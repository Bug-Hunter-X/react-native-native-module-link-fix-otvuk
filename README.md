# React Native Native Module Linking Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development: errors stemming from incorrectly linked or missing native modules.  This typically manifests as runtime crashes or unexpected behavior, particularly when using third-party libraries that depend on native code.

## Problem Description

React Native relies on native modules to access device-specific functionalities (camera, GPS, etc.) and certain third-party libraries are built upon them.  If these native modules aren't properly integrated into your app's build process, your app will fail.

## How to Reproduce

The `RN_NativeModuleError.js` file illustrates a component attempting to use a native module (`MyNativeModule`) that might not be correctly linked.  Running this component will likely lead to an error or crash, depending on your setup and whether the native module is present.

## Solution

The `RN_NativeModuleSolution.js` file contains approaches to address this problem.  These can include verifying the native module's installation, ensuring you have the correct native dependencies, and double-checking your project configuration (Android's `android/app/build.gradle`, `settings.gradle` and iOS's Podfile) to ensure all the native components are linked properly.  Also, use the `react-native link` command if applicable.
