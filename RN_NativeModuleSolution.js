Several steps can be taken to resolve native module linking issues in React Native:

1. **Verify Native Module Installation:** Ensure the library you're using is correctly installed and that its native dependencies are included. 

2. **Manual Linking (if necessary):** Libraries that don't automatically link might require manual configuration:

   - **Android:** Inspect `android/app/build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` to ensure that the library's native components are correctly incorporated into your project's build process.
   - **iOS:** Check your Podfile and run `pod install` to ensure CocoaPods properly includes necessary native dependencies.

3. **`react-native link`:** Use this command to attempt automatic linking, although manual verification is often still needed.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  After making changes to your native code, clean your project and perform a fresh build to ensure changes are properly incorporated. In Android Studio, use "Clean Project" and "Rebuild Project".

5. **Check for Errors:** Carefully examine build logs (Xcode, Android Studio) for messages indicating linking failures, missing dependencies, or compilation issues.

```javascript
// Example of improved component using error handling
import { NativeModules, Platform } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const MyNativeModule = Platform.select({
    android: NativeModules.MyNativeModuleAndroid,
    ios: NativeModules.MyNativeModuleIOS,
  });

  const useNativeFeature = () => {
    if (MyNativeModule) {
      try {
        MyNativeModule.someNativeFunction();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error using native module:', error);
      }
    } else {
      console.warn('Native module not available.');
    }
  };
  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Use Native Module" onPress={useNativeFeature} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
